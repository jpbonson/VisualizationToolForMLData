TODO LIST:
    New features:
    - Make zoom feature work with mouse scroll wheel.
    - Add option to choose the size of the scatter matrix, to improve visualization for datasets with lots of features.
    - Add filter per class, so the data for some classes could be hidden to remove noise.
    - Update the histograms to use stacked bars, so each bar will have the quantity per range and per class.
    - Make star plot work correctly for negative values.

    Code refactoring:
    - Move the CSS code from the scatter matrix and star plot .js files to the .css files.
