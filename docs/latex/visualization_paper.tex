% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in

% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{caption}


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

Visualization can be used to better understand the data for categorization tasks and effectively apply machine learning techniques. This work presents a visualization tool for the analysis of high-dimensional classification data, that integrates scatter matrix, histograms and star glyph representations. The system has the features of selection, filtering, and zooming, including options for automatic filtering using feature selection algorithms. The system was tested extensively to avoid bugs, and provide smoothly integrated behaviors.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{V}{isualization} techniques graphically presents the information in order to allow a better understanding and analysis of the data by the users. It is a powerful method to improve the decision-making process based on data for fields such as biological sciences, engineerings, and computer science. In the case of the machine learning domain, the visualization of the dataset is essential to gather insights, find patterns and define the most effective techniques to process and analyze the data. Scatterplots \cite{utts2014seeing} are one of the most popular approaches to visualize multidimensional data with simplicity, expressiveness and clarity. Scatter matrices \cite{carr1987scatterplot} expands scatter plots, allowing the visualization of various dimensions at the same time. Star glyphs \cite{ward2008multivariate}, or star plots, are also a recognized visualization technique for multi-dimensional data, where a glyph can be used to represent a single data point, all the values for a single attribute, or a summary of the data point values across all attributes. Considering the classification domain, this project represents each class by a glyph, and each dimension by an axis. Where the axis range is the minimum and maximum values for that attribute, and the points composing the glyph polygon are the average of the values for that attribute for a class. Since that the projection of all the dimensions may be too complex and hide the data main characteristics, feature selection and feature extraction techniques \cite{lewis1992feature} can be used to improve the dataset visualization. 

This work uses Python, Javascript and D3 to implement a system for the visualization and analysis of datasets for classification tasks in machine learning problems. It is composed of an integrated visualization of the dataset using scatter matrix, histograms and star gryphs. The users are able to select data points, that are shown across scatter plots and are updated on the star plot. Another feature is the filtering of attributes, that also modifies the visualization on both charts. The last feature is the zooming of charts on the matrix, so that the data can be seen in more details. The next sections are organized as follows. Section 2 will briefly compare this work against previous works. In the Section 3 the system implementation and details of its features will be explained. Section 4 presents the conclusion and the future work.

\section{Related Work}

This section will give an overview of similar works that focus on visualization of datasets using scatter matrices, scatter plots, or star plots. In  \cite{peng2004clutter} the authors work on reduction of information clutter, in order to improve the understanding of the visualization of a dataset without modifying the data itself. The authors applied their technique to parallel coordinates, scatter plot matrices, and star plots. They produced better visualization, with clearer shapes for the star plots and a more organized distribution of the data for the scatter matrix. In a future work, this project could be improved with information clutter reduction to further enhance the data analysis. The work in \cite{elmqvist2008rolling} investigate new interactions to explore multidimensional data using scatter plots and scatter matrices. Some of the new features presented are interactive queries, dimension reordering, and 3D navigation, all focused on comparing and correlating dimensions across the dataset. \cite{eisemann2014nested} also focus on exploring the dimensions of the dataset. Their technique consists of creating a hierarchy of scatter plots using decision trees and subplots, instead of analyzing the dimensions using a scatter matrix. Their approach allows the user to decide how she wants to interactively visualize and relate the different dataset dimensions using an exploratory method.

\cite{kandogan2000star} developed a technique for multidimensional data,  Star Coordinates. The method is similar to a star plot, but uses points instead of a glyph to represent the data, and each point represents a data point, instead of a summary of the values. Each axis have different sizes, depending on the range of values in the dataset. The authors goal was to enhance the user ability to obtain insights through the data visualization. In \cite{fanea2005interactive} work, star glyphs and parallel coordinates were merged as a way to improve the clarity of parallel coordinates for high-dimensional datasets. \cite{teoh2003starclass} present StarClass, an interactive visual classification method for multi-dimensional data that uses star coordinates to display the data points of the dataset. Besides the location on the star coordinates, each data point is represented as a set of centered lines, where each line size means the value of the data point for an attribute.

The main difference of this project regarding the previous work is that it uses the integrated visualization of scatter matrix, histograms and star glyphs, so that all visualization are integrated for all the possible interactions (selection, filtering, and zooming). Among the related work, this project uses star glyphs differently, by presenting a summary of information, for each class and each attribute. Each glyph represents the minimum, maximum, and average values of all the data points, or only for the selected data points. The goal of this work is to produce a tool that could be used for real-world machine learning problems, that is able to analyze any classification dataset in the CSV format. The related work is interesting as a way to further improve the current project.

\section{Visualization Tool}

\begin{figure}[!t]

  \captionsetup{justification=centering}
  \includegraphics[width=6.0in]{images/overview}
  \caption{System interface for the Ecoli dataset, composed of menu (upper left), star plot (lower left), and scatter matrix (right).}
  \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Main System}
This work implements a visualization system for the analysis of high-dimensional classification data for machine learning problems. The server side of the code was implemented in Python, using the Web framework Flask \cite{flask} and the machine learning library scikit-learn \cite{sklearn}, that was used to implement the feature selection algorithms. Javascript was used on the client side, along with D3 \cite{d3} and JQuery. Figure \ref{fig:overview} shows the tool interface. The main parts of the system are the scatter matrix, the star plot, and the interactive menu. The input is a CSV file with the attributes, classes, and data points. It is possible to work with any data in the CSV format. The current code has the files for the Iris \cite{irisdataset} and Ecoli \cite{ecolidataset} datasets. In Figure \ref{fig:overview} the system is loaded with the Ecoli dataset, and on Figure \ref{fig:overview2} the system is loaded with the Iris dataset, that have a very different quantity of classes, attributes, and data points. The tool is able to generalize for datasets with various quantities of classes, attributes and data size successfully.  In the next subsection details of the system parts will be further explained.

\subsubsection{Menu}
The first part of the menu, 'Classes', has all the classes in the dataset and its colors representations. The second column presents the attributes of the dataset, where the checkboxes can be used to filter them. Below, the 'Zoom' options enable the user to choose the indexes of the chart that she wants to zoom. It isn't a very practical approach, so in the future it may be improved to work with the mouse wheel or with a smaller sample version of the scatter matrix. The last option on the menu is 'Filter Algorithms', that provides three machine learning approaches for feature selection. All the three approaches rank the attributes importance and use a threshold to choose the best ones. The user is informed if the threshold choice filtered out all or none of the attributes, and in both cases the data visualization isn't modified.

\subsubsection{Scatter Matrix}
The scatter matrix crosses all attributes data and shows scatter plots for each combination of attributes. For the cells were row and column represents the same attribute, a histogram is presented showing the distribution of the attributes across range of values. The name of each attribute is located at the histograms. The scatter matrix axis has the horizontal and vertical axis for each scatter plot, organized in ticks of five values.

\subsubsection{Star Plot}
The star plot has an axis for each attribute, where the range of the axis is proportional to the range of the attribute values. Each class is represented as a colored glyph. The glyphs show the average of the values for each class, for all selected data points. If no data point is selected, it shows the average for all the dataset. The maximum and minimum values in the axis is the maximum and minimum  possible values for that attribute.

  \centering
  \captionsetup{justification=centering}
  \includegraphics[width=5.0in]{images/overview2}
  \caption{Visualization of the Iris dataset.}
  \label{fig:overview2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interactions}

\subsubsection{Selection}
The user can use brushing to select data points in one of the scatter plots. All the points representing the same data in the other scatter plots will also be selected. The star plot is updated to represent the average of the selected data points for each class. Figure \ref{fig:selection_integrated} shows the integrated visualization of the selected points in the scatter matrix and the star plot. Besides the integrated selection, the histograms and the star plot also have unique selections, as shown on Figure \ref{fig:selection_parts}. By passing the mouse over the bar of a histogram, it is highlighted and shows the range of values that are contained in the bar. For the star plot, the user can pass the mouse over a point or a colored area of a class. The polygon representing that class will be more opaque while the other classes will become more transparent, so the class's glyph can be clearly seen. If the user pass over a point, the value of that point will be shown as a tooltip.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Zoom}
The zoom function enables the user to expand a chart in the matrix, either a scatter plot or a histogram. The zoomed chart occupy the whole matrix space, and the data is shown in more details. Figure \ref{fig:zoom} presents a histogram and a scatter plot with zoom. The horizontal and vertical axis use twice ticks to represent the data range, and the histogram also uses two times the number of bars to represent the data distribution.

  \includegraphics[width=6.0in]{images/zoom}
  \caption{Zoom of histogram (left), and of scatter plot (right).}
  \label{fig:zoom}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Manual and Automatic Filtering}
Users can filter the dataset by selecting the attributes checkboxes, or by applying automatic filter methods. The scatter matrix and the star plot are modified to the new quantity of attributes. There are three algorithms available: Random Forest Classifier \cite{breiman2001random}, Chi-Square Test \cite{moore1976chi} and Variance Threshold \cite{wang2010comparative}. The Random Forest method scores the features by their importance using the construction of multiple random decision trees. Chi-Square Test calculates dependence between stochastic variables, to remove features that are likely to be independent of class, i.e. that are irrelevant for the classification task. The Variance Threshold method keeps all features with non-zero variance, or to a variance higher than the threshold, to remove features that have similar values for all data samples. As a matter of curiosity, among the three methods the one who provided the best results was the Random Forest technique.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically

% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This paper present a visual analysis tool for datasets, focused on classification problems in the machine learning domain. The main components of the system are the integrated visualization of scatter matrix, histograms and star plot. The final user can interact with the data by using selection, filtering, and zooming, that work integrated across visualizations, and also has specific interaction with each component. The star plot summarizes the dataset by providing, for each attribute and each class, the minimum, maximum, and average values for the selected data points. The system helps the understanding of the dataset by providing ways to visualize it using various dimensions, such as the average of values per class, how the attributes interact with each other,  and how they are distributed across the possible values. The tool also provides automatic feature selection, so the user can focus in the main parts of the dataset. It is possible to obtain insights of the overall dataset, of specific selection of attributes, and of a group of data points. Some features should be improved in a future work. The zooming feature could be more practical and be used by scrolling the mouse wheel or by clicking in a smaller version of the scatter matrix. Another filtering option could be added, to allow the user to filter the dataset by classes. Also, a relevant modification would be to show the histograms as stacked bars, organized by classes colors, so that the user would be able the analyze how the attributes values are distributed across range values and classes. A last improvement would be to apply the technique described by \cite{peng2004clutter} and \cite{elmqvist2008rolling} to reduce the information clutter and allow the reordering of the charts in the matrix,  enhancing the user ability to understand the data.
